- 👋 Hi, I’m @AkimaRas
- 👀 I’m interested in programming, obviously, anything that’s mechanical (automobiles, airplanes, etc.) the night sky, writing, JRPGs, and TOLKIEN!! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of coding languages at once, along with piano, and Japanese in the background.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing, yet? I don’t deem myself good enough for that now. Maybe soon!
